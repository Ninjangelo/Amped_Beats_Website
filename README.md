<br/>Amped Beats is a University-Based Website Application Project combining the use of Front-End and Back-End to carry out the idea of having a website that enables customers with the intention to book for an available DJ (Disc Jockey) from the collection of DJs displayed on the platform that is suited to their preferences on the event or agenda that they are hosting for the DJ that they decide to book for.
<br/>
Additionally, whilst customers benefit from the the idea, we have also entailed the website application to allow DJs of many categories such as those that are self-employed or even label-owned to be able to register and advertise their services and products on the platform.
<br/>
<br/>
Both Customers and DJs are able to track their bookings and view them in detail of each one in the dedicated section of their account portal. In any case they want to edit certain information in terms of their account, they are able to through an Account Information Editing Feature. In the coming future, we plan to intgrate the ability to be able to communicate between Customers and DJs through an in-built chat environment.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, this Website Application Solution is aimed to help both Customers and DJs satisfy their ease of finding suitable DJs to provide service for their events and handle their bookings and communications all in one environment instead of having to utilise separate services on different platforms.
